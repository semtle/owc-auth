# Contribution guide

First of all, you rock! Issues, criticism and pull requests are all welcome!

Let's set up a few ground rules though, just so we can all get along.

1. If you find a bug, please open an issue. It doesn't matter if you can't accurately describe it, we'll help you track
   it down. However, if you want it fixed, you may have to help us with sample code or by debugging your own code.
2. If you want to contribute, please create a fork of this repository and develop your change there. Once you think
   you're finished, feel free to open an issue or a pull request so we can take a look at your work. If you need help,
   let us know.
3. If you contribute anything, your work will be released into the public domain. That means *anyone* can use your work
   for *any* purpose without crediting you. If you're not OK with that, please don't contribute.

Simple, right?
